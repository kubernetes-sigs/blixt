# Blixt

An experimental [layer 4][osi] load-balancer for [Kubernetes][k8s] with a
control-plane built on [Gateway API][gwapi] in [Golang][go] with
[Operator SDK][osdk]/[Controller Runtime][crn], and an [eBPF][ebpf]-based
data-plane built in [Rust][rust] using [Aya][aya].

> **Note**: The word "blixt" means "lightning" in Swedish.

## Current Status

This is presently a work-in-progress. The project goals are currently:

- [ ] support [Gateway][gw]/[GatewayClass][gwc]
- [ ] support [UDPRoute][udproute]
- [ ] support [TCPRoute][tcproute]
- [ ] use this as a basis for adding/improving [Gateway API Conformance Tests][gwcnf]
- [ ] plug this into [Gateway API][gwapi] CI to run conformance tests on PRs

After these goals are achieved, further goals will be decided.

> **Note**: [TLSRoute][tlsroute] support may be on the table, but we're looking
> for someone from the community to champion this.

> **Note**: The initial proof of concept was written as an XDP program, but
> with more features (including access to ip conntrack in newer kernels)
> available in TC, the maintainers are most likely going to be converting
> this to a TC program soon.

> **Note**: There is an open question as to whether the data-plane should be
> implemented standalone behind the `Gateway` resources, or if it might make
> any sense or be advantageous to implement it as a backend for [KPNG][kpng].
> This is something the maintainers intend to determine before a `v1` release.

## Usage

> **Note**: Currently usage is only possible on [Kubernetes In Docker
> (KIND)][kind] clusters. You can generate a new development cluster for
> testing with `make build.cluster`.

Deploy [Gateway API][gwapi] [CRDs][crds]:

```console
kubectl kustomize https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd/experimental?ref=v0.5.1 | kubectl apply -f -
```

Deploy:

```console
kubectl kustomize config/default | kubectl apply -f -
```

At this point you should see the `controlplane` and `dataplane` pods running
in the `blixt-system` namespace:

```console
$ kubectl -n blixt-system get pods
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
blixt-controlplane-cdccc685b-9dxj2   2/2     Running   0          83s
blixt-dataplane-brsl9                1/1     Running   0          83s
```

Check the `config/samples` directory for `Gateway` and `*Route` examples you
can now deploy.

## Community

This project originally started at [Kong][kong] but is being [donated to
Kubernetes SIG Network][donation]. It is becoming a part of the [Gateway
API][gwapi] project and as such is discussed in the [Gateway API weekly
meetings][gwapi-meet].In particular, we do some discussion and paired
programming of this project on the `Gateway API Code Jam` meeting which
is on the [calendar][gwapi-meet] for every Friday.

You can also reach out with problems or questions by creating an
[issue][issues], or a [discussion][disc] on this repo. You can also reach out
on [Kubernetes Slack][kslack] on the `#sig-network-gateway-api` channel.
