# Note: We intend to support running the control-plane on multiple operating systems to enable
# more development and testing from non-Linux systems, even though the dataplane strongly requires
# Linux (due largely to eBPF). This library is utilized by the controlplane, and as such we must
# not include any crates that are linux only. doing so this should not include any crates that are
# linux only. Doing so will break the controlplane on other systems (e.g. MacOS which along with
# Linux is a common development environment for our contributors). This includes crates belonging
# to this workspace that import third party linux only crates.
